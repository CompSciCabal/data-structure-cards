Data Structure Cards
====================

A card-based approach to learning about data structures. Think baseball, but more tree-shaped.

Want to contribute? Pick a card, any card, and submit a pull request that fleshes out its information. Or add a brand new data structure! (If you don't know where it should go drop it into cardsets/sortme.)
