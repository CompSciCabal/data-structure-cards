Notes:

Signatures unlock optional operations, like 'peek-first' and 'length' for a stack -- some stack definitions have peek and length operations, but others don't. 

If an operation expects an asymptotic time complexity greater than O(1) then list it next to the operation. Likewise if it expects non-constant additional space to be used while performing the operation that should be listed. Otherwise the assumption is that constant time and space are sufficient for every required operation.

The required and optional operations will be edge-printed in two different colors, for quick scanning over the concrete set for matches. Cards could also be notched in a fashion that allows even faster finds over the concrete collection. We could include instructions on doing this for those who only intend to use the cards as a reference guide.

Each card has a unique url on the DSC site that provides more detailed information, algorithms, links to papers and resources, quotes, etc.

Each abstract card needs both an operational schematic and a whimsical representation.
