Four different levels of design:
- simple consistent card back
- accurate image for each DS (design language for representing structural aspects)
- overall layout for the card information (plus mod knobs for expansion decks)
- fancy image for each DS (should to be able to commission these widely)

Art for data structure cards:
1. Back of card
  - separate for Abstract and Concrete
2. Datastructure representation pictures
  - One possible sub-project is a visual language for data structure definition/specification
3. Individual card art
  - Fanciful representations of the data structures
4. Card layout
  - Layout of specific cards
  - Probably separate for abstract and concrete
  - Incorporates the representation with some detailed information about a particular structure



ABSTRACT
========

Above possibly notated by a list of all possible operations, with one edge-printed color for required and another for optional, and all other operations listed but greyed out and neutrally labeled. Time expectation might turn out to always be consistent per-operation, rather than per-card, in which case it could be denoted elsewhere -- for example, an info sheet providing an explanation of the operations.
