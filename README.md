Data Structure Cards
====================

A card-based approach to learning about data structures. Think baseball, but more tree-shaped.

Want to contribute? Pick a card, any card, and submit a pull request that fleshes out its information. Or add a brand new data structure! (If you don't know where it should go drop it into cardsets/sortme.)

----------

Notes:

Please stick to the abstract and concrete templates while creating new cards -- we need uniformity among all cards for the system to work.

Likewise, when adding information to existing cards please take care to keep the template intact, or impose it upon the card if it isn't already. Be bold! (But also be careful.)
