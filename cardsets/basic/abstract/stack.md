STACK

push: add to end pop: remove from end

*peek: get value of next pop *count: get length

implementations: :: linked list: O(1) :: array: O(1), but fixed size [you can only have one at a time], mutation? :: dynamic array: O(1), amortized, (mutation?)

--> historical note: Turing was the first one to refer to a stack, called operations 'bury' and 'unberry' --> sigs from Turing's grand-students
